# Technology Stack

## Build System & Tools
- Build system: To be determined based on chosen technology stack
- Package manager: To be selected (npm/yarn for Node.js, pip for Python, etc.)
- Version control: Git (recommended)

## Development Standards
- Use consistent code formatting and linting
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Include appropriate documentation

## Common Commands
Commands will be added once the tech stack is established. Typical patterns include:

```bash
# Install dependencies
# Build project
# Run tests
# Start development server
# Deploy/release
```

## Dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained
- Regularly update to secure versions
- Document any specific version requirements
