# Project Structure

## Current State
The workspace is currently empty and ready for initial project setup.

## Recommended Organization
When setting up the project, consider this structure:

```
/
├── src/           # Source code
├── tests/         # Test files
├── docs/          # Documentation
├── config/        # Configuration files
├── scripts/       # Build and utility scripts
├── .kiro/         # Kiro AI assistant configuration
└── README.md      # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## File Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Group related files in appropriate directories
- Keep file names concise but meaningful

## Code Organization
- Separate concerns into logical modules
- Use consistent directory structure
- Place configuration files at appropriate levels
- Keep root directory clean with essential files only
